The recent versions that work with our real NICO robots and the vrep NICO robots are

nico_humanoid_upper.json (work with all robots)
nico_humanoid_legged.json (works with real legged robot and all vrep robots)

All the other json file are only included for legacy reasons. Please use only the two ones anymore.
