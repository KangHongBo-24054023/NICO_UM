Welcome to highNICO's documentation!
====================================

highNICO is a high-level API to control the NICO robot.

Currently, there are two ways of communication implemented:

 * Use the python class :class:`Motion.Motion` to access control to motors
 * Use ROS through :class:`RosNico.RosNico`

For more information you could look at the wiki at https://git.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/wtm/NICO-software/wikis/home
