Current status of development (MK):

Issue with hand not responding on every 2nd initialization DONE
- issue is known - workaround: use idle skript & restart application DONE

Add Integrity Constraint for external cameras DONE
- check for file existance DONE
- evaluate of any error ever occurs

Checking quality of data
- disruptions & breaks in sound file - possilbe solutions
  - decrease and monitor loadon the entire system (load max when writing images)
  - move one cymera to another usb port
  - reduce resolution of images


Re-evaluate settings for integrity constraints - ensure the experiment runs well most of the time
- MAX_NUM_DIF_CAMS = 10 (error occurs too often - almost no trial under 10 frames difference)

Evaluate rate of successful trials
- often check fails for image count - do we accept a difference there?
- sometimes check fails for sound/image duration - could be related to errors in sound recording
- rarely some odd errors - restar helps
