Current status of development (MK, ES, SH):

Issue with hand not responding on every 2nd initialization DONE
- issue is known - workaround: use idle skript & restart application DONE

Add Integrity Constraint for external cameras DONE
- check for file existance DONE
- evaluate of any error ever occurs

Checking quality of data
- disruptions & breaks in sound file - possilbe solutions DONE
  - decrease and monitor loadon the entire system (load max when writing images)
  - move one cymera to another usb port
  - reduce resolution of images
- lag in the update of motor positions (and only positions - not currents)
  - look again at the 

Fixed directory of plot files DONE

Enter new object set and create new database DONE
- Adapt list of objects DONE

Re-evaluate settings for integrity constraints - ensure the experiment runs well most of the time
- MAX_NUM_DIF_CAMS = 10 (error occurs too often - almost no trial under 10 frames difference) DONE
- MAX_POS_DIFFERENCE = 25.0 DONE
  <-- this is very unrealistic: 25 deg. in 1/30 second ? but we often have these    errors - need to check   
  if this occurs consistently or in any way linked to movement patterns.
  - could be that this is linked to the hardware malfunction in the hand - maybe encoder not working
  - find out which joint is offending - is this consistant?


Run PILOT with simple objects (sponge & tissue)
Count acceptes vs. rejected samples

Results are listet here: 16 trials should be needed - occuring errors are listed below

1. OK - but grip too weak, object slipped during lifting
2. OK
3. FAIL - Pos difference (27.87)
4. FAIL - difference between exspected camera picture and recorded ones too high:
          cam1-diff: 26 cam2-diff: 32
5. OK
6. OK
7. FAIL - Pos difference (28.05)
8. FAIL - difference between exspected camera picture and recorded ones too high:
          cam1-diff: 26 cam2-diff: 32
9. OK
10. FAIL - difference between exspected camera picture and recorded ones too high:
           cam1-diff: 25 cam2-diff: 31'
11. OK
12. OK
13. OK
14. FAIL current to high: 32979.0 - could see problem with the wrist-z
15. OK
16. FAIL - difference between exspected camera picture and recorded ones too high: cam1-diff: 25 cam2-diff: 31
17. OK
18. FAIL: difference between exspected camera picture and recorded ones too high:
          cam1-diff: 25 cam2-diff: 32
19. FAIL: 'Pos difference', 'current to high: 16542.0', 'current to high: 16542.0'
20. FAIL: difference between exspected camera picture and recorded ones too high: cam1-diff: 25 cam2-diff: 32
21. OK
22. FAIL: Pos Difference

2nd trial

only failures due to position of joints - mostly during lift/scoot trials
















Integrate GUI into recording script

Check Observer-HD recording - DONE.
- camera resolution is wrong - 1920x1080 for hd and VGA for rgb+d
- camera image not sharp - ok

Checked Observer-Depth recording
- issues with wrong duration (speed seems to be slow - double length of recording)
- quality of depth sensing is bad - white vs. black surfaces are messured differenty - black surfaces are     almost not registered - all DONE, was wrong max depth distance

Evaluate rate of successful trials
- often check fails for image count - do we accept a difference there?
- sometimes check fails for sound/image duration - could be related to errors in sound recording
- rarely some odd errors - restar helps
