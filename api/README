1. Python API

highNICO provides a python API in the form of a python class which can
be used to communicate with the NICO robot. The API is completely 
included in the file 'highNICO.py'. To use it in python you can simply
import it, e.g.:

   from highNICO import HighNico

You can then create an object representing a single robot.

   robot = HighNico(motor_config='NICO.json')

The robot can then be controlled by invoking the different methods, e.g:

   robot.closeHand('RHand')

1. ROS API

The ROS API is a wrapper which makes most of the highNICO functions 
available over ROS.

To build the ROS package it should be sufficient if you move the 
'high_nico' folder into your catkin_workspace 
($CATKIN_WS/src/high_nico/) and build the packet ('catkin_make').

There are multiple ways to start the wrapper, e.g.:

   rosrun high_nico rosNICO.py
   roslaunch high_nico high_nico.launch

There are also multiple parameters with which you can influence the
behaviour of the robot. You can use the following command to see them:

   rosrun high_nico rosNICO.py -h
